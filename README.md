# `jumpmodels`: Python Library for Statistical Jump Models


`jumpmodels` is a Python library offering a collection of statistical jump models (JMs), an unsupervised algorithm designed for regime identification in time series data. 
It includes implementations of the original discrete JM, the continuous JM (CJM), and the sparse JM (SJM) with feature selection. 
The library follows a [`scikit-learn`](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn)-style API and supports `pandas.DataFrame` for both input and output.

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install:

```bash
pip install jumpmodels
```

`jumpmodels` has the following dependencies:

- Python 3
- `numpy` 
- `pandas`
- `scipy`
- `scikit-learn`


All dependencies can be installed with:

```bash
mamba install pandas scikit-learn hmmlearn matplotlib
```

Replace `mamba` with `conda` or `pip` if you haven't installed `mamba`.


- `matplotlib`
- `yfinance`
- `jupyterlab`

## Usage


```python
from jumpmodels.jump import this
# Add more usage examples later
```



## Examples


The figure on top illustrates an example use of the sparse JM, showing the in-sample fitted regimes based on the value factor index’s daily active returns relative to the market. 
Further details are available in Shu and Mulvey (2024), as listed in [References](#factor).


A comprehensive example application using the Nasdaq Composite Price Index series with a simple feature set can be found in the `example/nasdaq` directory.
